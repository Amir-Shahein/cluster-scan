#    def restrict_hits_annot(self, dfOfHits, annotFilename):Upgrade method to be able to accept a threshold for the ChIP score, in order to accept a promoter!#I may also want to adjust the thresholds for distance from TSS to be equal, for both the EPDnew threshold (currently -1000 -> +100)#as well as the ENCODE threshold via. the paper# Write a method to process weird overlaps into sensible ones (like (-6) (-6) into a single (-3) ) # ONE problem is that we may be artificially inflating the amount of individual binding sites compared to clusters# by truncating -1000 --> +100 relative to TSS. For instance,  what if  we declare  the first binding site  to be  a# single binding site, but it's really the last member of a cluster which is "off screen" (this  can be  applied  to# the other side as well)#  Something else a bit confusing, is that I am looking at sites in the promoter... but it's not clear#  that this is actually how transcription factor binding works! i.e. mediator complex/cofactors should be integrating#  TF binding... which may occur far from RNAP binding site, for instance on enhancers... Although we are#  Looking pretty  far upstsream, i.e. -1000, which is  good, and this is the standard in the field, likely# for  a decent reason.----STAT.MECH MODEL-----It's interesting that two overlapping consensus binding sites, would be predicted to have an occupancy of 0.666... whereas one consensus binding site alone would have an occupancy of 0.5. I should make sure this is correct, and test the statmech model further. It might make sense from an entropic perspective, even though it's unintuitive from a simple energetic perspective.
